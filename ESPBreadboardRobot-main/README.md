# ESP32 Breadboard Robot
A device designed to mount to a breadboard to breakout the ESP32-C3 devboard pins, add an LED matrix, dual motor drivers, photoresistor inputs for line following, and two buttons.
Designed to mimic (some) functionality of the BBC micro:bit + Kitronic Motor Driver Board combo currently used by Lincoln High School for teaching electronics, at a lower cost and in a more convenient package.
