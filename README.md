# ESP32 Breadboard Robot
A device designed to mount to a breadboard to breakout the ESP32-C3 devboard pins, add an LED matrix, dual motor drivers, photoresistor inputs for line following, and two buttons.
Designed to mimic (some) functionality of the BBC micro:bit + Kitronic Motor Driver Board combo currently used by Lincoln High School for teaching electronics, at a lower cost and in a more convenient package.

## Software
The software is designed to support exporting blocks from MakeCode directly into main.py. Basic, LED, Input and Motor blocks are currently supported. src/ and lib/ have the required files to enable this.

## Hardware
The schematic and PCB designs are included in /hardware.
